# Info Slider
Simple slider function to update an info panel. This is a little time challenge to build this from scratch with ES2015 and jQuery only. I will continue to add features for fun.
See example [here](http://kyleconkright.github.io/info-slider/)

`{direction: 'rtl'}` to reverse the panel flow.

`{fade: true}` to fade in new element.

`{speed: 1000}` transition speed. If fade is enabled, it will fade in at 4 times this speed.
